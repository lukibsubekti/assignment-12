# OOP Benefit for Application
OOP can help application for generating & maintaining entities which are used during lifecycle of the application. The entities may be plentiful and have similiraties with one another. A program entity can be seen as a real-world object that has attributes/traits and capabilities/procedures that can be run. OOP also enables an entity to inherit its attributes to other entities. This can be helpful in refactoring and classification of entities.  

# Sample Project
## Purpose
This project aims to create a game application that allows its users to create their hero character in the game. There are three character types. The game also maintain its state about number of heros, number of availalbe skills, and rules. 

## User Stories
1. User can create a hero character with name, type, and skill. Character types are Paramecia, Logia, and Zoan. Skill is unique, choosen from available list in the game, and related to the character type.
1. User character is assigned with base damage and bounty by the game during character creation.
1. User character can increase their damage and bounty by fighting with other characters.
1. User character damage will be decreased/increased by random number generated by the game during fight. User with greater damage will win the fight. If oppenent skill is listed in user weakness, the user will lose.
1. Logia type character has trait to be invicible for other characters with close damage amount, but it has more weakness.
1. Zoan type character has trait to be increased with larger damage by the game during fight.
1. Paramecia character has empty weakness.

# Pseudocode
```typescript

class Hero {
    name: string;
    skill: string;
    weakness: string[];
    damage: number;
    bounty: number = 0;

    getNewBounty(opponent:Hero) {
        // opponent.bounty + 1000
    }

    getNewDamage(opponent:Hero) {
        // opponent.damage + 10
    }

    isWinTheFight(opponent:Hero) {
        // (opponent.skill in this.weakness) --> false

        // (this.damage - opponent.damage + Game.getAdditionalDamage()) > 0 ? true : false
    }

    fight(opponent: Hero) {
        // if isWinTheFight() then:
        //     getNewBounty()
        //     getNewDamage() 
    }
}

class Logia extends Hero {
    isWinTheFight(oppenent:Hero) {
        // (opponent.skill in this.weakness) --> false

        // (this.damage - opponent.damage) > -60 --> true
      
        // (this.damage - opponent.damage + Game.getAdditionalDamage()) > 0 ? true : false
    }
}

class Zoan extends Hero {
    isWinTheFight(oppenent:Hero) {
        // (opponent.skill in this.weakness) --> false

        // additional = Game.getAdditionalDamage()
        // if additional > 0 then:
        //      additional = additional * 2
      
        // (this.damage - opponent.damage + additional) > 0 ? true : false
    }
}

class Paramecia extends Hero {
    isWinTheFight(oppenent:Hero) {      
        // (this.damage - opponent.damage + Game.getAdditionalDamage()) > 0 ? true : false
    }
}

class Game {
    logiaSkills: {name:string, weakness:string[], isUsed:boolean}[];
    zoanSkills: {name:string, weakness:string[], isUsed:boolean}[];
    parameciaSkills: {name:string, weakness:string[], isUsed:boolean}[];

    createHero(name, type, skill) {
        // getBaseDemage()
        // create hero
        // mark the used skill
    }

    getBaseDamage() {
        // return random number [100 to 200]
    }

    getAdditionalDamage() {
        // return random number [-40 to 40]
    }


}
```
